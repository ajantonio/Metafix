## Metafix

Metafix is a web application and an orthopedic service online ordering system

## Client's Business Overview

The business of the project client is about providing orthopedic services. The focus of their service is to sell orthopedic implant and assist the orthopedic doctor in their orthopedic surgery using the orthopedic implant that the orthopedic doctor bought. Those who assists are called orthopedic technician. Orthopedic technician delivers the orthopedic implant and assists the doctor by utilizing the orthopedic implant during the surgery

## Motivation

Metafix is initiated by the main contributor and lead developer of the project, Adrian John Antonio. He is also the son of the project client and saw the inefficient business workflow of the client's business and messy organization of orthopedic implants in their business inventory. He found out the solution to the problem after
constantly meeting with the project client, thus Metafix was initiated.

## What to consider

**Do not code on the same file(s)**

Avoid overlapping your codes to another developer's codes. Overlapping codes have high chance of getting an error. It's okay to work on the same folder.

## Errors founded and their solution

**Can't run 'npm run dev' command after installing Laravel's vue ui auth**

if running 'npm run dev' didn't worked, type 'npm i vue-loader' to update your vue-loader package and type npm run watch. That should solve the problem.
